// This is an empty ArmSubsystem- how strange!
// Based on what we learned about member variables and types of objects, make a member variable for each of these functions:
// An arm motor (class is CANSparkFlex), arm encoder (class is AbsoluteEncoder), target angle, whether we are in the correct position
// or not, an arm debouncer (class is Debouncer), a timer (think you can figure this one out?), and a counter.
//Make sure you put the variables in the right part of the subsystem!
